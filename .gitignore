# .gitignore
# Exclude all files which are likely to contain sensitive data, such as
# password, private keys, and other secrets. These should not be part of version
# control as they are data points which are potentially sensitive and subject
# to change depending on the environment.

# Ignore sensitive Terraform variable files
*.tfvars
*.tfvars.json

# Ignore Terraform state files
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.backup

# Ignore Terraform directories
.terraform/

# Ignore the Terraform lock file (comment this out if you want to track it)
.terraform.lock.hcl

# Ignore generated plan files (optional, but usually good to ignore)
*.tfplan
